This datapack only adds 2 recipies, but the vanilla behavior of lights allow you to:

Change the light level - simply right-click the placed light block with a light item in your hand. This does not consume the item<br />
Replace a light blockwith any other block. (Light blocks act like air, just place any other block on the space they inhabit.<br />
Light blocks can be waterlogged.<br />
